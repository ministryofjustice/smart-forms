Smart Forms
===========

The goal is to make it simple to prototype forms that can be traversed question by question, with support for going back to any point in the form filling process.

The form can be written in a slightly modified HTML syntax (see compensation-wrongful-conviction.html), and the linked JavaScript takes care of the form flow. A YAML syntax allows for an even simpler form design.
